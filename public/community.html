      <p>Our mission at MySQUAR is to connect the people of Myanmar through consumer technology. We want to facilitate the creation
        and sharing of information and ideas through a broad, accessible and authentic online experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Providing a balance between free expression and the needs of a diverse public are important to ensure a happy community.
        With that in mind, we’ve created the following community standards to help shape what sort of content is acceptable
        and what content may be reported or removed.
      </p>
      <h3>Violence, Bullying and Threats</h3>
      <p>We aim to keep our channels free of any online violence, bullying, threats or abuse on our platform. We will take action
        to report or remove any behaviour that we perceive to be endorsing physical harm, or a threat to public safety.
      </p>
      <h3>Hate Speech</h3>
      <p>We strive to make a distinction between satire and humorous expression and serious speech. Attacks based on race, ethnicity,
        national origin, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities or medical conditions may be reported or removed.
      </p>
      <h3>Graphic Content</h3>
      <p>We expect that people who share content on our platform should do so in a responsible manner. If inappropriate content
        is shared in a public manner it may be reported or removed. This includes both graphic violence and content of a
        pornographic nature.
      </p>
      <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
      <p>Before sharing content on our platforms, please be sure you have the rights to do so. Please respect copyrights, trademarks,
        and other legal rights.</p>
      <h3>Phishing and Spam</h3>
      <p>We ask that you refrain from contacting users for commercial purposes without prior consent.
      </p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>Privacy and security is something we take seriously. We work to keep your information secure from outsiders.
      </p>
      <h3>Reporting Abuse</h3>
      <p>If you see something on any MySQUAR product that you believe violates these standards, you should report it to us.
        Please keep in mind that reporting a piece of content does not guarantee that it will be removed from the site. Because
        of the diversity of our community, it's possible that something could be disagreeable or disturbing to you without
        meeting the criteria for being removed or blocked. For this reason, we also offer the ability to block users.</p>
